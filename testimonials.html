                    <p>“We heard about HomeIntel from a mailer we received and thought we would give it a try. Once we signed up, they sent us a helpful email immediately identifying some of the things they thought were worth investigating for energy use reduction. They also identified how much energy was being spent by different items in our house that we had no idea were so costly. The Energy Coach Chris came out to our house and the first thing he did was to suggest that we reduce the pool pump's hours. There are always competing concerns: the pool service had set the pump to run a lot to prevent algae from forming in the pool, but that number of hours was expensive. We were able to find a happy medium between the two options. The coach recommended resetting the circulation pump - previously running at 1000 watts/hour for 8 hours - to 3 hours and reducing the sweep hours as well. He also moved the timeframe when the pumps ran so we would be set for lower electric rates when the Time Of Use rate plan from PG&E kicks in. In addition, we have Marantz audio equipment in our media room which used 85 watts in standby mode and 850 watts when operating. We now have them plugged into a power strip and we simply flip the switch on when we want music. All in all, it has made a significant difference in our monthly bills.”

                    <p>"The Energy Coach from HomeIntel came to our house after we had tried everything. Our energy bills had gone crazy and we couldn't tell what was causing it. We were extremely careful about using the gas heating and the lights and even kept a record of energy usage to try and track it down. Nothing was working. When we heard about HomeIntel we were skeptical but thought it worth a try. We enrolled in the program and shortly thereafter Chris came to our house, measured everything along with us, and found within 20 minutes that two heated bathroom floors that we thought had been turned off were both running 24/7 despite the temperature being set at the lowest point. He turned off the floor heaters at the breaker box and then checked the HEA website for changes over the next week or two and kept in touch with us. What a difference! We saw a drop of $125 in 2 months and another drop of $55 the month after. We are delighted that PG&E even offers this program and encourage anyone else who wonders what is going on with their energy bills to contact Home Energy Analytics."

                    <p>“Patti Sexton is my family’s assigned energy advisor. I called her on Friday hoping to hear back in the next week or so. I was delighted when she called me right back and spent at least 30 minutes responding to my questions about cooling our house’s living quarters in an energy efficient manner. Patti was extremely knowledgeable and most helpful in her advice. She listened to all my questions about the tradeoffs between fans, room air conditioners and central air conditioning and then gave me expert advice on how to use each most efficiently. She even explained to me how my home absorbed heat during the day and then resisted falling to the outdoors ambient temperature at night as my house radiated heat. I could not have been more impressed and pleased with the advice that she gave me… Patti is definitely a valuable resource for PG&E and its customers.” </p>
